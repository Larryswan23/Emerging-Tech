This repository contains two notebooks, "tasks.ipynb" and "project.ipynb," each addressing specific aspects related to quantum computing. 
The notebooks explore tasks in quantum computation and a project focused on Deutsch's Algorithm, a fundamental quantum algorithm known for its efficiency.

The purpose of this repository is to provide educational content and practical demonstrations of quantum computing concepts.
The "tasks.ipynb" notebook covers various tasks related to quantum computation, while the "project.ipynb" notebook delves into the exploration of Deutsch's Algorithm using Qiskit.

# Contents

1. **tasks.ipynb**: This notebook includes tasks that i completed throughout the year as part of my emerging echnologies module

2. **project.ipynb**: This notebook focuses on exploring Deutsch's Algorithm, a quantum algorithm known for its efficiency. The notebook includes explanations, visualizations, and implementation details using Qiskit.
